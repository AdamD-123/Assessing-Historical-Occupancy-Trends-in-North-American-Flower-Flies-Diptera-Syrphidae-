# Assessing Historical Occupancy Trends in North American Flower Flies (Diptera: Syrphidae)

Given the declines occurring in many insect populations around the world, there is an urgent need to assess large-scale trends in important groups like pollinators. Museum data and biological collections present unique opportunities to assess population trends over long historical timescales. Here, I use a hierarchical Bayesian multi-season, multi-species occupancy model to estimate long-term, range-wide occupancy changes for 318 North American syrphids, which are the most common pollinators of major crops after bees. I also validate the accuracy of the model using Prior Predictive Checks, Simulations, Posterior Predictive Checks, and a Sensitivity Analysis.
